- **_`fizzbuzz`_**
Write a program that prints the integers from   1   to   100   (inclusive).  
But:  
  - for multiples of three,   print   Fizz     (instead of the number)
  - for multiples of five,   print   Buzz     (instead of the number)
  - for multiples of both three and five,   print   FizzBuzz     (instead of the number)  
  
  **Done** -> [fizzbuzz.go](https://github.com/evro23x/goprog/blob/master/algorithms/fizzbuzz.go)

- **_`bubble sort`_**
Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that sequentially goes through an array n times.  
Each time the algorithm runs through our array,  
it looks at the first element and then the second element,  
if the first element is larger than the second element then it swaps them,  
it then proceeds through the entire list performing this action.
